# Step 1 - Understanding the Verilog code:
## Module Declaration:
led_red - Output - Controls red led.

led_green - Output - Controls green led.

led_blue - Output - Controls blue led.

hw_clk - Input - Transfers clock signal.

testwire - Output - Used for Debugging.
## Internal Signals:
int_osc: A wire that will carry the output of the internal oscillator.
frequency_counter_i: A 28-bit register used to count clock cycles.
## Test Wire Assignment:
The testwire is assigned the value of the 6th bit of the frequency_counter_i, which can be used for debugging or monitoring the counter's state.
## Frequency Counter:
This always block increments the frequency_counter_i on the rising edge of the int_osc signal. This effectively counts the number of clock cycles from the internal oscillator.
## Internal Oscillator:
This instantiates a high-frequency oscillator (SB_HFOSC) with a division factor of 2 (CLKHF_DIV ("0b10")). The oscillator is powered up (CLKHFPU(1'b1)) and enabled (CLKHFEN(1'b1)), producing a clock signal on int_osc.
## RGB Driver Instantiation:
This instantiates an RGB driver (SB_RGBA_DRV) that controls the RGB LED. The RGBLEDEN signal enables the LED driver. The RGB0PWM, RGB1PWM, and RGB2PWM signals control the pulse-width modulation (PWM) for the red, green, and blue channels, respectively. In this case, the blue channel is enabled, while the red and green channels are set to off.
## RGB Driver Parameters:
These parameters set the current levels for each color channel of the RGB LED. Each channel is set to a low current level.

# Step 2 - Creating a PCF File:
It is noticed that the pin assignment in the pcf file given in the repository is different from the pin assignment in datasheet.
## Pin assignments mentioned in the given repository:

led_red = Pin 39

led_blue = Pin 40

led_green = Pin 41

hw_clk = Pin 20

testwire = Pin 17


## Corrected Pin assignment:
led_red = Pin 39

led_green = Pin 40

led_blue = Pin 41

hw_clk = Pin 20

testwire = Pin 17
