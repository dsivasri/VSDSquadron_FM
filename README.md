# <ins> Step 1 - Understanding the Verilog code: <ins>
## Module Declaration:
- led_red - Output - Red LED Output
* led_green - Output - Green LED Output
+ led_blue - Output - Blue LED Otput
- hw_clk - Input - Hardware Clock Input
* testwire - Output - Test Signal or Wire
## Internal Signals:
int_osc: A wire that will carry the output of the internal oscillator.
frequency_counter_i: A 28-bit register used to count clock cycles.
## Test Wire Assignment:
The testwire is assigned the value of the 6th bit of the frequency_counter_i, which can be used for debugging or monitoring the counter's state.
## Frequency Counter:
This always block increments the frequency_counter_i on the rising edge of the int_osc signal. This effectively counts the number of clock cycles from the internal oscillator.
## Internal Oscillator:
This instantiates a high-frequency oscillator (SB_HFOSC) with a division factor of 2 (CLKHF_DIV ("0b10")). The oscillator is powered up (CLKHFPU(1'b1)) and enabled (CLKHFEN(1'b1)), producing a clock signal on int_osc.
## RGB Driver Instantiation:
This instantiates an RGB driver (SB_RGBA_DRV) that controls the RGB LED. The RGBLEDEN signal enables the LED driver. The RGB0PWM, RGB1PWM, and RGB2PWM signals control the pulse-width modulation (PWM) for the red, green, and blue channels, respectively. In this case, the blue channel is enabled, while the red and green channels are set to off.
## RGB Driver Parameters:
These parameters set the current levels for each color channel of the RGB LED. Each channel is set to a low current level.

# <ins> Step 2 - Creating a PCF File: </ins>
It is noticed that the pin assignment in the pcf file given in the repository is different from the pin assignment in datasheet.
## Pin assignments mentioned in the given repository:
- led_red = Pin 39
* led_blue = Pin 40
+ led_green = Pin 41
- hw_clk = Pin 20
* testwire = Pin 17
## Corrected Pin Mapping:
- led_red = Pin 39
* led_green = Pin 40
+ led_blue = Pin 41
- hw_clk = Pin 20
* testwire = Pin 17
## Significance of each connection:
### 1. led_red (Pin 39):
In the provided Verilog code, the Red LED (led_red) is instantiated but not actively driven to emit light. Although the Red LED is currently off, it is included in the design, indicating that it could be used in future modifications of the code. If we change .RGB0PWM (1'b0) into .RGB0PWM (1'b1), the Red LED will glow.
### 2. led_green (Pin 40):
Similar to the red LED, the green LED is included in the design, indicating that it could be utilized in future modifications. If we change .RGB1PWM (1'b0) into .RGB1PWM (1'b1), the Green LED will glow.
### 3. led_blue (Pin 41):
Unlike Red and Green LED, the Blue LED (led_blue) is actively driven to emit light. We could make Blue LED off by changing .RGB2PWM (1'b1) into .RGB2PWM (1'b0).
### 4. hw_clk (Pin 20):
Although hw_clk is present, it is not utilized in any logic or processes within the current code. Instead, the design relies on an internal oscillator (int_osc) generated by the SB_HFOSC primitive.
### 5. testwire (Pin 17):
The primary significance of testwire is its role in debugging and testing the design. By exposing a specific bit of the frequency_counter_i, developers can monitor the state of the counter without needing to connect to a more complex debugging interface. This can help verify that the counter is functioning correctly and incrementing as expected.

# <ins> Step 3: Integrating with the VSDSquadron FPGA Mini Board: </ins>
## Integration steps:
- First I connected the board to the computer through an USB Cable.
- Then I created 3 folders named red_led, green_led, blue_led for glowing Red, Green, Blue LED respectively. In each of these folders, I included Makefiles, top.v code and .pcf files.
- Then I opened terminal and coded as below.
